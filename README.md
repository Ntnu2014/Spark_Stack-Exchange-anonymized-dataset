Followings are the steps:
1-Edit source code in a main.py file, classes in a separate classes.py (Class definitions need to be written in a separate file and then included at runtime.)
2-Run locally on a chunk using eg. $SPARK_HOME/bin/spark-submit --py-files src/classes.py src/main.py data/stats results/stats/
3-Run on GCP once your testing and development are done.
